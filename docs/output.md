# sanger-tol/variantcalling: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [DeepVaraint](#deepvariant) - VCF and GVCF GZ files generated by DeepVariant
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### DeepVariant

Here are the files you can expect in the `variant_calling/` sub-directory for two of samples, for example, `sample1` and `sample2`.

```text
variant_calling/
├── sample1_T1_deepvariant.g.vcf.gz
├── sample1_T1_deepvariant.vcf.gz
├── sample2_T1_deepvariant.g.vcf.gz
└── sample2_T1_deepvariant.vcf.gz
```

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `variantcalling_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
